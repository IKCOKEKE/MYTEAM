Variable is a container that holds data which can be manipulated during the program execution. When you declare a variable, you are essentially reserving a space in memory to store a specific type of data, such as numbers, text, or objects. Variables have a data type, such as int, or String, or which determines the kind of data that can be stored in them. In Java, you need to declare the type of the variable before using it.
