Class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviours that objects of the class will have. Classes in Java are used to create objects, encapsulate data, and define methods to manipulate that data. They serve as the foundation for object-oriented programming and allow you to model real-world entities with their characteristics and behaviours.
