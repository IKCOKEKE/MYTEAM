Good afternoon everyone. Hope we all are doing great.

Please I wish to express my personal opinion. This is regarding the midweek classes. Working and studying here is not easy. And one has to work so as to meet up with bills and other challenges. I have not even had time to reverse what we did on Saturday, due to work. Sadly again, I will miss tonight's class. 

Although these classes are recorded, it will be nice to have a full understanding and practice of each class before the next lecture. Unfortunately, I have come to realise that doing this with 2 classes every week is becoming almost impossible (Maybe for me). 

I'm aware that this session is expected to last for 8 months, and covering all that we need to learn within that time flame might be difficult. However, I do believe that the most important thing is for everyone who has chosen to go into IT, and as such registered for this session to come out well prepared for IT challenges. I therefore will suggest that this classes be held ones a week to allow us read and practice what we have been taught before the next class. Hence extending the session to 12 months instead of 8 months will be okay. 

Like I said earlier, this is a personal opinion. 

Cheers.
